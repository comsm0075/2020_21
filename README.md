## Information Processing and the Brain 2020/2021

Here you can find the relevant content for Information Processing and the Brain 2020/2021. This unit covers several aspects of information processing in the brain, such as sensory processing, probabilistic codes, deep learning, recurrent neural networks, credit assignment, reinforcement learning and model-based inference.

It is jointly taught by Conor Houghton and Rui Ponte Costa at the
Department of Computer Science [School of Computer Science, Electrical
and Electronic Engineering, and Engineering Mathematics], Faculty of
Engineering, University of Bristol.

### Recommended reading:

This field is highlight interdisciplinary, as such there is no single textbook that covers all our lectures. Relevant research papers will be highlighted during the lectures. However, below we highlight **in bold** the most relevant ones for this unit.

Theoretical neuroscience:

1. **Theoretical Neuroscience by P Dayan and L F Abbott (MIT Press 2001)**, see also errata.
2. Neuronal Dynamics by Wulfram Gerstner, Werner M. Kistler, Richard Naud and Liam Paninski. Full version online.
3. Introduction To The Theory Of Neural Computation, Volume I by John Hertz. (Classical and accessible book on neural computation)
4. Bayesian Brain: Probabilistic Approaches to Neural Coding
5. **Elements of Information Theory by TM Cover and JA Thomas (Wiley)**, worth owning, but there is an online pdf from [www.cs-114.org](http://www.cs-114.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Elements_of_Information_Theory_Elements.pdf "Cover and Thomas pdf")
